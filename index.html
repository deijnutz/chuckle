    <h1>Have a chuckle at the expense of Texas Ranger, Cordell Walker! I mean, Chuck Norris!</h1>
    <p>When I was a kid, I was raised by my Texan grandma, Becky. Becky absolutely adores the Western genre of film and television. As a result, I have seen every single episode of "Walker, Texas Ranger" at least twice.</p>
